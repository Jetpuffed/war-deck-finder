# War Deck Finder

War is a two player card game entirely dependent on randomness. There is no strategy. The outcome of the game is determined by the order of the deck. If you aren't already familiar with War, here's a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)) article to get you up to speed.

## About

All this program does is attempt to find the lowest amount of rounds for a single game of War. It will loop over and over again until the counter reaches the pre-configured maximum value of an unsigned 32-bit integer. I made no effort in making the code look pretty, and made no attempt to optimize the loop.
